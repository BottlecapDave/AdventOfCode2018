# Advent Of Code 2018

These are my solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/2018) for 2018.

As this is my first year, I wanted to try it in a language I knew so all solutions are in `C#`. They can be executed using the provided unit tests, which were used to verify the solutions using the provided examples before submission.
